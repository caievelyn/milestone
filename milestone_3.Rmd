## Milestone 3
The article I am replicating is Daniel Smith et. al's "Identifying voter preferences for politiciansâ€™ personal attributes: a conjoint experiment in Japan". It is about whether voters really do prefer candidates with certain characteristics (immutable or not, such as gender and experience), or whether these preferences are induced by other causes such as PR vs. first-pass-the-post systems or regional vs. national political party organizing. For example, voters may not inherently prefer male candidates over female candidates, but may be induced to choose male candidates because of a first-pass-the-post system, in which there is less coordination among national parties to ensure their party's candidates are diverse and representative enough. Smith et. al chose a conjoint experimental method, which has recently become very popular in political science, to randomize every characteristic of a fake candidate so that the treatment effect of each characteristic can be parsed out later statistically.

What I did with the data thus far:
Their code is all in base R. I rewrote their data pre-processing code and plot-creating code using tidyverse/dplyr stuff. We love tidyverse stuff. Below is the code. I created a series of eight mosaic tables, the first four of which examines gender, the latter four of which examines age. Next, I created a rudimentary AMCE plot which examines the average treatment effect of gender for candidates for the lower house. The mosaic plots are numerically correct and match the original charts. However, the AMCE plot's numbers are wildly different. My next steps are to figure out why they're different and how to fix it.
